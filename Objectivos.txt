1. Churn of the new products
•	Churn happens when person does not pay the first payment in the first 15 days  (We can use Flag_Anul_FP_DI, to see how churn between 0-15 days in the company)

•	at this point pricing can be changed

•	people often ask for insurance plan to then negotiate with their current company

2. Churn between payments

•	someone with 1 year contract and quarter payments can just not pay second quarter and then they automatically churn  (We can use SITAPOL (CN) to see how churn between contracts)

•	At this point, pricing can not be changed, but maybe they can offer something else

•	people sometimes need insurance quickly, so they pay 1st payment, then have time to look for better options and churn before 2-nd payment


3. renewal churn

•	customers pay for full year, regardless of the payment option (yearly/quarterly/monthly), but do not pay the first payment for the next year (We can see it with feature "dias" between 365 - 730)

•	here the price of the product changes automatically

•	customers might find increased payment inadequate and choose to search better offer
