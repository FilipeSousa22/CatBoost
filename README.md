#My first use of CatBoost

This program is to evaluate the prediction of churn in the insurance company.

What I did:

- Cleaning the data
- Evaluate about the shape, missing values, replacement of NAN
- Creation of a function to show me the accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, to understand better my CatBoost.
- Creat CatBoost model
- Confusion Matrix
- Sort the predictions 
- Upload the some examples of Shapley Values
